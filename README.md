# UFO Sightings - Fact or Fancy

## Overview of Website and Assignment
This project was to create a website that enables a user to search for UFO Sightings across the United States. To complete this website, a fully dynamic table was created. This table allows user to search for a specific occurrence using date, location, and UFO shape as criteria. An explanation of website usage follows. 

This website uses for UFO sightings uses JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js. The table uses a JavaScript array and utilizes filters to find specific data. For the website visualization, Bootstrap was used to modify the outlay and setup of the website. NOTE: This site contains only data from January 1, 2010 through January 15, 2010. Even with limited data, there are plenty of points to review! 

## How to Use the Site

The first image below shows the search and filter section of the website. There are five (5) options to filter the data for a specific UFO sighting. This filter section is located just below the introduction paragraph.

For this example, El Cajon, California was selected as multiple sightings have occurred in this area. First the city was filtered using the "city" filter criteria. There is a total of five (5) sightings found in our data.

If the user is specific to a date, they can then narrow down their search further to a specific date. For this example, the sighting in El Cajon, California on January 4, 2010 was selected. The list was filtered from five (5) options to the one (1) option that meets both criteria.

## Updates and Changes
This website is limited to a narrow amount of data, which is quite dated as this point. There is likely updated compilation of data available which could be linked to this website and automatically updated. Further, I would recommend modifying the filter function to allow for different date types, ignore capital/lowercase letters, and search for partial terms. This would allow for a better website experience and allow a user to input terms in their standard verbiage. For example, 1/1/2010 and 01/01/2010 will provide the same information. Prior to more changes to the site, the data should be cleaned to ensure consistency throughout the data. Under the duration column, the data specifies multiple abbreviations of the word "minute". This may be an indication the data in the entirety could contain errors.
